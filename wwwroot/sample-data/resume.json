      "description" : "Software development intern. During this internship, - I practiced my software analysis and design skills,. I set up an automatic update system for all the company's software with C#. This system can be individually integrated with applications or a utility for managing updates of all company software. I created a development server with FLASK providing information and update file download routes. I created integration services with Python and integrated the update system with KYA-SolDesign software (PV system sizing software: https://en.kya-energy.com/products),. I started the update utility implementation with .NET MAUI (similar to JetBrains Toollbox). I designed a PyQt python module that automatically generates PyQt views with CRUD actions. A database and a table are passed as parameters and the view is generated"
